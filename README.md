## Capstone Project for Bangkit Academy 2021 by B21-CAP0165 team ##
### Background ###
The students who have difficulties in learning activities because they do not have additional access courses, the lack of peer recognition in the surrounding environment so that it requires access to appropriate study groups. Then, we've decide to provide them who wants to have a study group that same as their major also same education level as they take without additional courses and also because we want to change the mindset that in the era of revolution 4.0 in terms of learning can be done online which is considered more practical, personal, cost-effective, and more fun. Then, our alternative for this problem statement is we want to try to build study groups instead of providing online courses because it's accessible for everyone who wants to access it without paying and itâ€™s assisted by the government.
