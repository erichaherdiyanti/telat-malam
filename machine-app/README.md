Machine Learning path contribution in this project is to train the machine
so this machine is able to classify student based on what they fill in the questions that has provided in the earlier page of the application

Learning algorithm used in this project is decision tree algorithm 
which this is one of the famous algorithm used to classified data to to some classes

The output of this application will classify student based on what they fill in the question page
